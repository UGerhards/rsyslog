========

.. index::
   single: mmnormalize; ruleBase
   single: ruleBase

.. summary-start

Sets the rulebase file used for normalization.

.. summary-end

This parameter applies to :doc:`../../configuration/modules/mmnormalize`.

:Name: ruleBase
:Scope: action
:Type: word
:Default: none
:Required?: yes
:Introduced: at least 6.1.2, possibly earlier

Description
-----------
Specifies which rulebase file is to use. If there are multiple mmnormalize
instances, each one can use a different file. However, a single instance can
use only a single file. This parameter or ``rule`` MUST be given, because
normalization can only happen based on a rulebase. It is recommended that an
absolute path name is given. Information on how to create the rulebase can
be found in the
`liblognorm manual <http://www.liblognorm.com/files/manual/index.html>`_.
