.. summary-start

Names the JSON property whose values are counted on matching messages.

.. summary-end

This parameter applies to :doc:`../../configuration/modules/mmcount`.

:Name: key
:Scope: module
:Type: word
:Default: none (count messages per severity)
:Required?: no
:Introduced: 7.5.0

Description
-----------
Directs mmcount to evaluate a structured property on each message that
matches :ref:`param-mmcount-appname`. The property name is given exactly
as it appears in the message's JSON tree (for example ``!gf_code``).

If the named property is absent, mmcount leaves the message unchanged and
no counter is modified. When the property exists, its value is converted
into a string (JSON ``null`` becomes an empty string) and used to select
which counter to increment. Without :ref:`param-mmcount-value`, mmcount
creates a distinct counter for every observed value and writes the
running total for that value into the message's ``mmcount`` property.

Module usage
------------

.. code-block:: rsyslog

   action(type="mmcount" appName="glusterd" key="!gf_code")
