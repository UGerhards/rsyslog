Selects how invalid byte sequences are detected and replaced.

This parameter applies to :doc:`../../configuration/modules/mmutf8fix`.

:Name: mode
:Scope: input
:Type: string
:Default: "utf-8"
:Required?: no
:Introduced: 7.5.4

Description
-----------
Sets the basic detection mode for invalid byte sequences.

``utf-8`` (default)
    Checks for proper UTF-8 encoding. Bytes that are not proper UTF-8 sequences are replaced with the character defined by :ref:`param-mmutf8fix-replacementchar`. If a multi-byte start byte is followed by any invalid byte, the entire sequence is replaced. Control characters are not replaced because they are valid UTF-8.

``controlcharacters``
    Replaces all bytes that do not represent a printable US-ASCII character (codes 32 to 126) with the character defined by :ref:`param-mmutf8fix-replacementchar`. This invalidates valid UTF-8 multi-byte sequences and should be used only when characters outside the US-ASCII range are not expected.

Input usage
-----------
.. _mmutf8fix.parameter.input.mode-usage:

.. code-block:: rsyslog

   module(load="mmutf8fix")

   action(type="mmutf8fix" mode="controlcharacters")
