:Name: separator
:Scope: input
:Type: char
:Default: ,
:Required?: no
:Introduced: 7.5.1

Description
-----------
This is the character used to separate fields. Currently, only a single
character is permitted, while the RainerScript method permits to specify
multi-character separator strings. For CEF, this is not required. If there
is actual need to support multi-character separator strings, support can
relatively easy be added. It is suggested to request it on the rsyslog
mailing list, together with the use case - we intend to add functionality only
if there is a real use case behind the request (in the past we too-often
implemented things that actually never got used).

The fields are named f\ *nbr*, where *nbr* is the field number starting with
one and being incremented for each field.

Input usage
